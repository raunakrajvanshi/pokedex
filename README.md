Pokémon Type Classifier
This script is designed to classify Pokémon types using images of Pokémon. It utilizes deep learning techniques implemented with TensorFlow and Keras to train a model to recognize the type of a Pokémon based on its image.

Requirements
To run this script, you need the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
pandas
OpenCV
Matplotlib
You can install these dependencies via pip:

Copy code
pip3 install tensorflow keras numpy pandas opencv-python matplotlib
Usage
Dataset Preparation:

Place your Pokémon images in a directory named images. Each image file should be named after the Pokémon it depicts (e.g., charizard.png).
Make sure you have a CSV file named pokemon.csv containing Pokémon names and their corresponding types.

Training the Model:
Run the script pokemon_type_classifier.py.
The script will load the Pokémon images, preprocess them, and train a neural network model to classify Pokémon types.
After training, the script will print the model summary and display the training history (accuracy and loss over epochs).
Making Predictions:

You can make predictions using the trained model by calling the predict_pokemon(image_path) function, where image_path is the path to the Pokémon image you want to classify.
Example:
python
Copy code
image_path = './images/charizard.png'
predicted_pokemon = predict_pokemon(image_path)
print("Predicted Pokémon:", predicted_pokemon)
Evaluating Model Accuracy:

The script automatically evaluates the accuracy of the trained model on the provided dataset.
It compares the predicted Pokémon types with the actual types and calculates the overall accuracy.
Model Architecture
The neural network model architecture consists of:

Input layer: Flatten layer to flatten the input image.
Hidden layers: Three dense layers with ReLU activation function.
Output layer: Dense layer with softmax activation function, outputting probabilities for each Pokémon type.
Files Included
pokemon_type_classifier.py: The main Python script containing the model training, prediction, and evaluation logic.
pokemon.csv: CSV file containing Pokémon names and types.
images/: Directory containing Pokémon images.

Notes
Ensure that the Pokémon images are clear and centered to improve classification accuracy.
Experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and image preprocessing techniques to optimize performance.
Current Accuracy: 0.02
